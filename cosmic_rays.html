									<h2>What is cosmic radiaion?</h2>

<p>Discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess, cosmic rays are high-energy charged particles that originate outside the earth’s atmosphere. These particles travel at nearly the speed of light and are generally the nuclei of atoms but can also be other charged particles. At sea level, the atmosphere provides sufficient shield from these particles that continuously strike the earth from all directions. Initially it was believed that the radiation due to these particles is a type of electromagnetic radiation, which led to its name ‘cosmic rays’.</p>

<p>Before the discovery of these particles, the scientists were baffled by the ionising radiation in the atmosphere. They assumed that this radiation was emitted from the ground and various objects around us. Between 1911 and 1913, Victor Hess put his life at risk to conduct several daring hot air balloon flights to measure the variation of this radiation away from the earth. Using an electroscope, he measured the radiation until an altitude of 5.3km and recorded his observations that the ionizing radiation increased away from the surface of the earth. He concluded that these particles were penetrating the atmosphere from outer space. For this discovery, Hess received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936.</p>

<p>Before the age of particle accelerators, these particles proved to be an excellent source for the study of new particles and several particles were first discovered from the interaction of earth’s atmosphere with the cosmic rays. However, now that humans are moving towards the sky, we also need to consider the negative effects of these particles. Similar to several other radiations, exposure to cosmic radiation can cause harm to the human body with a possible change in DNA which may cause mutation or cancer. These particles can also cause soft errors in electronic systems and can affect the life of electronic devices. Cosmic radiation is suspected to be the cause of an in-flight incident that caused the plane to lose hundreds of feet of elevation.</p>

<p>Our experiment aims to develop a profile of cosmic radiation against altitude. This data will help in the understanding the variation of cosmic radiation and can contribute towards the development of space weather prediction models such as NASA’s NAIRAS model.</p>
